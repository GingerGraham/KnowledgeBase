# AWS Landing Zones

AWS Landing Zones are an implementation of AWS Organizations and AWS Control Tower designed to implement the AWS Well-Architected Framework. They are designed to help you implement a secure, compliant, and highly available environment in AWS.

AWS provides a wealth of documentation on Landing Zones and Control Tower which are a great place to get started; however in some details the directions they give may not be clear without context.
