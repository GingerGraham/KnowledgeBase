# KnowledgeBase

This repository is my personal knowledge base of collected knowledge and experiences

It is also published to my website at <https://www.grahamwatts.co.uk>

## New Articles

- Articles should be named replacing spaces with hyphons `-`
- All articles should start with the Jekyll Front Matter designator at the top of the page before any content
  - Not doing this will prevent the page being published on the website
  - Any pages that do not need to be published, such as this ReadMe can omit the Front Matter, or include `published: false` in the Front Matter

```yml
---
# Front Matter
---
```

```yml
---
published: false
# Explicit statement to prevent web publishing
---
```
