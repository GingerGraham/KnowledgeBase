# KnowledgeBase

This repository is my personal knowledge base of collected knowledge and experiences

It is also published to my website at <https://www.grahamwatts.co.uk>

## New Article Standards

- Articles should be named replacing spaces with hyphons `-`
  - e.g. `my-article`
- Do not create a self-built index on the page
  - When publishing to the web site, the index will be created by the site itself
  - Several markdown editors will create an index automatically
- Wherever possible include a short description of the detail and scope of the article immediately after the title

```markdown
# Title

This is an introductory short description of the article

The article contents continues below
